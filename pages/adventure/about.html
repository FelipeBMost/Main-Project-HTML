          <p>Adventure games focus on puzzle solving within a narrative framework, generally  with few or no action elements. Other popular names for this genre are “graphic adventure” or “point-and-click adventure”, but these represent only part of a much broader, diverse range of games.

            Adventure games are not based on what the dictionary defines as “adventure”. Some are, but many forsake danger and excitement for more relaxed, thoughtful endeavours. They are also not: role-playing games that involve extensive combat, team-building and points management; action/adventures such as Uncharted and Prince of Persia where puzzle-solving is clearly a secondary focus; pure puzzle games like Bejeweled or Tetris. <br><br>
            
            But labels can only take us so far. Many games push traditional genre boundaries in new and interesting ways while still remaining adventure games at their core. Dreamfall, sequel to the point-and-click classic The Longest Journey, includes some stealth and fight scenes. Heavy Rain is a new breed of interactive movie-style adventuring featuring motion controls and Quick Time Events. At the other end of the spectrum, titles like Mystery Case Files: Dire Grove mix in plenty of Where's Waldo?-styled scavenger hunts. Even Portal, which gives you a gun to solve physics-based puzzles instead of killing, has a right to be called an adventure.

            Of course, stories, puzzles, and exploration are not limited to just adventures. More and more games outside the genre are incorporating adventure game elements, like Scribblenauts, Braid and Limbo. Given their shared features, we will sometimes cover these as special “games of interest”, though always with the understanding that they fall outside the scope of our adventure game definition.

            Adventure games can be traced back to 1976, with the release of Colossal Cave Adventure. Developed by Will Crowther and Don Woods, this text-based game was inspired by Crowther's actual caving experiences. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, some games continued to be text-based, but others featured simple graphics as well. Some popular titles from this era include Zork, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and King's Quest. <br><br>

            In the 1990s, adventure games evolved to feature more complex graphics and puzzles. The genre was evolving and developers were taking advantage of new memory limits and technology. Popularity reached new heights with the release of Myst and multiple sequels to The Legend of Zelda. <br><br>

            In the 2000s, a new wave of developers began to experiment, releasing innovative franchises that pushed the boundaries of what an adventure game could be. These developers were influenced by the classics, but also brought their unique vision, resulting in a new wave of originals. Although some say this era displayed little innovation and could be seen as underwhelming, many of the franchises we see today came to life during this decade. Influential games such as The Longest Journey, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, God of War, and Uncharted became hits for their complex and emotionally charged stories, as well as their gameplay. <br><br>

            In the 2010s, the genre went through a rebirth. The success of earlier franchises and new platforms allowed developers to experiment with the exploration of bigger worlds, new gameplay mechanics, and storytelling techniques, which brought new titles such as The Walking Dead, Red Dead Redemption 2, and one of the most popular and well-received games of all time, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

            Today, adventure games are more robust and diverse than ever before. Developers continue to release sequels to earlier hits and introduce new titles. There are now adventure games for every type of player, from those who prefer to relax with a light-hearted game to those who want to be challenged by a complex and thought-provoking story.
